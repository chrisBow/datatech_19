Hi! Thanks for checking out this repository. Hopefully you're here because you saw my poster at DataTech19 and hope I got a chance to speak to you about it!

If I didn't, sorry I missed you, but hope you enjoyed the day.

I'm just working on getting all the code together and checking that no employer data or references are left in there. I hope to get all the code pushed before the end of March 19.

In the meantime, please feel free to contact me on Twitter (@chrisBowData) if you have any questions.

Thanks!
